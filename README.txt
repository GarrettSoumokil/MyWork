Sometimes it takes restarting the emulator to connect to the network and I think thats just an Xcode bug. All GC progress is saved and reported correctly. If no connection is present when loading GC, play the game through for a minute or so and that seems to be how long it takes to connect to network. Not sure the reason why.
